# Upgrades! What can go wrong;)


Netmet upgrades are not that hard, they have 1 or 2 steps

- Migrate Data (not always required)


## Rolling upgrades of code

- Upgrade all Netmet servers one by one
- Upgrade all clinets


## Data upgrades

- Run proper upgrade script e.g.: `python 0001_upgrade_data_v1_v2.py`
